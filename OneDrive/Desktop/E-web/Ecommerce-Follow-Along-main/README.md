# ⭐ Ecommerce Follow Along Project ⭐

Welcome to the **Ecommerce Follow Along Project**! This is a hands-on project where we will build a complete e-commerce application using the **MERN stack** (**MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js**). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

---

## ⭐ Milestone 1: Project Overview

### 🌟 M1. Understanding the MERN Stack
- **MongoDB**: A database for storing application data in a flexible, document-based format.
- **Express.js**: A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logic.
- **React.js**: A framework/library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server.

### 🌟 M2. REST API Structure
REST APIs allow communication between the frontend and backend. We'll create APIs for:
- **User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and log in.
- **Product Management**: Adding, updating, and retrieving product data.
- **Order Handling**: Managing customer orders.

### 🌟 M3. Database Schema Design
- Learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB.
- Define schemas to structure how data is stored and related.

### 🌟 M4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. For example:
- Users need to log in to place orders or see their personal data.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.

## ⭐ Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page Development

In this milestone, we set up the foundational structure for the project and implemented the first user-facing feature: the **Login Page**.

### 🌟 1. Project Folder Structure
We organized the project into two separate directories:
- **Frontend**: Where the React app lives.
- **Backend**: Where the Node.js/Express backend resides.

This structure helps manage frontend and backend code separately as the project grows.

### 🌟 2. React Frontend Setup
Initialized a new React application to build the user interface. This app serves as the foundation for all user-facing features of the e-commerce platform.

### 🌟 3. Node.js Backend Setup
Set up a simple Node.js server using Express to handle requests and API routes. This server will eventually power:
- User authentication
- Product management
- Order processing

### 🌟 4. Tailwind CSS Configuration
Configured Tailwind CSS to enable a **utility-first styling** approach for rapid and responsive design.

### 🌟 5. Login Page Development
Developed a **functional login form** with:
- User credential authentication
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- A modern user experience

## ⭐ Milestone 3: Backend Organization & MongoDB Connection

- **Set up dedicated folders** for organizing backend code effectively.
- **Initialized and configured a Node.js server** to handle API requests.
- **Connected the application to MongoDB** to store and manage data.
- **Implemented basic error handling** to ensure smooth server operation.

---

## ⭐ Milestone 4: User Model & File Uploads

- **Created a User Model** to define how user data is structured in the database.
- **Developed a User Controller** to manage user interactions (e.g., adding or retrieving data).
- **Configured Multer** to handle file uploads, allowing users to store files such as images.

---

## ⭐ Milestone 5: Sign-Up Page Development

- Built the **Sign-Up page** for user registration using **HTML and CSS**.
- Implemented **form validation** to ensure valid inputs, including:
  - Proper email format
  - Password security
- Enhances **user experience and error prevention**.
- Committed and pushed all changes to the repository.

---

## ⭐ Milestone 6: Backend Signup API

- Developed a **secure backend signup API**.
- **Encrypted passwords** using **bcrypt** before saving them to MongoDB.
- Ensures **secure user authentication and data privacy**.
- Committed and pushed all changes.
